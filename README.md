# Gaining insight on human early organogenesis through TRA expression analysis
## 2022-topic-04-team-01

### Abstract 
A single cell turns into a complex multicellular organism during embryogenesis. While the morphological steps are mostly
understood, the role of molecular pathways as well as transcriptional regulation in embryonic development is still a topic
of current research. Tissue restricted antigens (TRAs) may be a key in understanding the connection between gene
expression and morphological consequence. Since the expression of a TRA is speciĄc to its relative tissue, we could draw
conclusions about organ development from TRA expression patterns between week 4 and 9 of embryogenesis. Using
microarray data from Yi H et al. (2010), we created a dataset of differentially expressed transcripts, including genes not
found by Yi H et al., through limma analysis. Based on this data, we could successfully link developmental steps to TRA
expression patterns for some of the analyzed organs. Furthermore, we found individual genes associated with processes in
neurogenesis. Finally, we attempted without success to deĄne speciĄc TRAs as biomarkers for organogenesis.
