There, the functional GO annotation of all transcripts in our dataset (not only the differentially expressed ones) was compared to the functions associated with all TRAs of one tissue. The significance was determined by an adjusted p-value. Of those 10 functions, up to 5 were chosen to represent different groups of functions and avoid the overlap of highly related processes. For each of those, the median expression for each week was calculated and plotted, as seen in the expression graphs.\relax }}{2}{figure.caption.3}\protected@file@percent }
